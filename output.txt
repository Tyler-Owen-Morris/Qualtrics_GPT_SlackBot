Thank you for your feedback!Workflows allow you to trigger tasks based on various events. Examples include creating a ticket when someone opts-out of your XM Directory, sending a follow-up email to a customer after a low satisfaction score. For both the inciting event and the resulting task, you have a lot of options, most of which are inside the Qualtrics platform and some of which are outside.You can create workflows in two different places: in the Workflows tab of a project or in the the stand-alone Workflows page. The Workflows tab is available in survey, Engagement, Lifecycle, Ad Hoc Employee Research, and 360 project types. Unless the triggering event of your workflow relates directly to a survey, we recommend creating a stand-alone workflow.You can create workflows in multiple places in Qualtrics. Workflows function the same no matter where they are created. This section will cover how to access the different product areas where you can create a workflow.This section will go over how to create a workflow inside a survey and what the different components (events, conditions, and tasks) mean. While functionality is similar, the look and feel of workflow creation might differ on the stand-alone Workflows page.When you create a workflow, you indicate the event that should trigger it, the more specific conditions under which that workflow occurs (if needed), and then define the task that is executed as a result.For example, I want to send an email to the managers every time a customer reports a low CSAT. I also want to create a ticket when this happens, so our support team can address it.We collect CSAT in a survey – that means the event is the creation of a survey response.We only care if there’s a low CSAT, so the condition is something like, if the response to the CSAT question is 3 or lower, or if “highly dissatisfied” is selected. (This can differ, based on your organization’s benchmarks.)What task happens as a result of these kinds of survey responses? We send an email task to the managers and use a ticket task to make a new ticket for a support rep.Workflows can be scheduled, or they can be tied to a specific event. Scheduled workflows are useful when you want a task to occur on a regular basis. Events are most useful if you want to base a task on something specific happening in Qualtrics – e.g., sending an email or making a ticket based on how a respondent filled out a survey. In that example, the survey submission would be the event, and the email or the ticket would be the task carried out.Scheduled workflows allow you to create workflows that run at a specific time. You can set your workflow to run on a recurring basis, and you can choose when the workflow begins and ends.To create a scheduled workflow, select Started at a specific time (scheduled) when creating your workflow.
Then choose your desired schedule frequency. This can be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually. 
The next step will depend on your workflow’s frequency:Next, type in or click the drop-down to select the start time for your workflow.
If you would like the workflow to run multiple times on the same day, click Add a start time.
Next, select which time zone you want the workflow to run on. By default, the account’s time zone will be selected.
Then, choose when you want the workflow to start and stop running. By default, scheduled workflows will start running immediately after being activated and only stop running when deactivated. However, you can choose a start date and end date for your scheduled workflow instead.
Rather than waiting for a scheduled workflow to fire, you can trigger it with the click of a button. In the workflow editor, you can immediately cause a workflow to fire during the testing process.“Events” occur in Qualtrics (or other places) and cause a workflow to start. To create an event-based workflow, click Create a workflow, and select Started when an event is received.Many events can be used to start a workflow. The selected event will determine what kinds of conditions can be applied to the workflow. You can use the search bar at the top of the window to easily search available events. The events available to you will depend on your license and project. See below for a brief explanation of each event type.The events listed below are available to use in both the survey Workflows tab and the stand-alone Workflows page.The following events are only available when setting up an event-based workflow through the stand-alone Workflows page.When creating an event-based workflow, you can add conditions to determine more specifically when the workflow should fire. For example, you may not want to send an email to managers about every survey response submitted, but you may want to let them know when the customer indicated low satisfaction. Conditions are built by creating logic statements that use information from the chosen event. You can include multiple condition blocks in a workflow. When the workflow runs, the workflow conditions and tasks will be evaluated in the order they appear in the workflow editor. Thus, the initial condition must be passed before being evaluated for the next condition. As soon as a condition is not met, the workflow will not continue evaluating following conditions.To walk through the process of creating conditions for a workflow, complete the step-by-step below.You can add up to 20 tasks per workflow to follow-up on your research and survey responses. Each task type is capable of solving an array of problems. You can use the search bar at the top to of the task selector to search your available tasks. For a full list of tasks, check out the Tasks category in the Workflows section of support site. The below tasks can be used across the Qualtrics platform.ETL Workflows use data extracting and loading tasks to import data from a third-party source and import into Qualtrics. ETL workflows require you to use certain tasks with each other to complete your workflow. See Using Workflows Tasks to Build ETL Workflows for more information.Every workflow can have up to 20 tasks. The order that these tasks occur is important, depending on the needs of your workflow.Initially, the order of tasks matches the order in which they are created. The newest task is added to the end of the workflow. When an existing task is edited, it is also moved to the end of the workflow.The workflow also pays attention to what needs to happen first for a task to execute successfully. For example, if you are piping a field from a ticket you’ve created into an email task, the ticket creation task will happen first, followed by the email where the value is included, regardless of what order you created these tasks.As tasks are created, they are assigned IDs in the format T-ID-#. The ID of a task is set to the order in which it was created.The ID of a task never changes, and is merely an internal ID to help identify a task. It does not necessarily reflect the order in which a task will be triggered compared to other tasks in the same workflow.You can pipe information from one task into a following task. One of the fields you can pipe in is a ticket ID from a task where a ticket is created (for example, Zendesk, Freshdesk, or Jira). This value can be carried into any task that follows, such as an email task or even a Jira field.Example: I want to create a ticket in Freshdesk, and then pipe the ticket ID into an email that goes to my customer service representative to let them know a ticket has been made in their name. I make sure to set up the Freshdesk ticket task before the email task.Now when I customize my email task, I have the option to pipe the ticket ID into the email body.When selecting piped text from a preceding task, take note of the task ID (T-ID-#). This determines which task you’re pulling information from.The Qualtrics Workflows platform contains a series of tasks to assist in importing data from third-party destinations into Qualtrics or exporting data from Qualtrics to third-party destinations. These tasks follow the Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) framework. Using ETL tasks, you can create automated and scheduled workflows to bring data from third-party sources into Qualtrics as well as export data from Qualtrics to third-party destinations.The order of tasks in a workflow is important when using workflow tasks to set up ETL workflows. See the linked support page for more guidance on this specific use case.The calculate metric task in Workflows allows you to trigger a response to aggregate metrics observed in a dataset over a period of time. In other words, it provides a way to set up automated workflows based on trends or events you observe in experience data. The results of your calculate metric task can be used to trigger other tasks within your workflow.The order of tasks in a workflow is important when calculating aggregate metrics. See the linked support page for more guidance on this specific use case.While editing a workflow, a toolbar will appear at the top of the workflow to help you navigate every aspect of your workflow.
When creating a new workflow, you will have the option to use a Qualtrics template. These are pre-configured workflows designed to make setting up useful workflows easy. Workflow templates are created by our Qualtrics subject matter experts to leverage industry standards for workflow automations.Below are a few example templates. This is not an exhaustive list of available templates. Log into the platform to begin exploring all of the options available to you.All workflows in your project are listed in the Your workflows section. From here, you can search workflows by specific properties, disable and enable workflows, and copy and delete workflows.
The table shown in this section displays key information about your workflows:
The top of the Your workflows section has a search bar and filters for searching workflows.
You can edit, rename, copy, delete, and manage notifications for a given workflow.You can enable, disable, or delete workflows in bulk.By navigating to the Run history section of the Workflows tab, you can quickly ascertain the status of all your workflows or filter them by status, so you can look at all workflows that have competed, failed, or timed out. Once you click on a failed task, you’ll see more details that can help you troubleshoot the source of the issue.Note that there are two different Run history tabs: one on the main workflow page, and one when you are editing a specific workflow. The Run history tab on the main workflow page aggregates all workflow run data within your project. To view the Run history for a single workflow, click into the workflow and navigate to the Run history tab within that workflow.For more information on using this section, see Workflows Run and Revision Histories.While editing a workflow, you can go to the Revision history tab to see a log of every change that has been made to your workflow.
For more information about using revision history, see Workflows Run & Revision Histories.The Notification settings tab allows you to set up alerts to be notified when a specific workflow fails or succeeds. See Workflow Notifications for more information.
The Sharing and permissions tab allows you to manage who has access to your workflow.For more information on sharing workflows with other users, see Sharing Workflows.
