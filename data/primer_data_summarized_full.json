They can be added to Engagement and CX dashboards by including unique identifiers in the dataset. There are two types of hierarchies: static and dynamic. Static hierarchies add hierarchy information directly to the survey response data, while dynamic hierarchies link the hierarchy to the dashboard data. Parent-Child and Level-Based hierarchies are the primary types, with Level-Based hierarchies being more commonly used in CX Dashboards. They can handle incomplete hierarchies better than Parent-Child hierarchies. Qualtrics builds the hierarchy based on the participant file uploaded, and circular logic in the chain of command is not allowed. In addition to Parent-Child and Level-Based hierarchies, there are two more rarely used hierarchy types. Dynamic org hierarchies can be configured to filter data in CX Dashboards based on the user's level in the hierarchy. Guided action planning allows managers to drive impact in areas employees care about and can be customized with culture-specific content.

  "Static vs. Dynamic Org Hierarchies": "https://www.qualtrics.com/support/vocalize/user-admin-cx/org-hierarchy-cx/carrying-unique-identifiers-into-a-dashboard-dataset/ To add org hierarchy information to your dataset, ensure the dataset includes unique user identifiers. In an imported data project, include a column with identifiers in the CSV file. For survey projects, ensure that the correct information is pulled into the survey before mapping it to the dashboard. There are two methods to achieve this.\n\nMethod 1: Add hierarchy information as additional embedded data directly to the survey response. This method is static and won't reflect hierarchy updates on existing data. Add the embedded data field and org hierarchy to the survey flow and include the unique identifier field in the contact list.\n\nMethod 2: Link the hierarchy to the dashboard data for dynamic updates. Match the unique identifier in the response to the user's identifier in the hierarchy. Hierarchy updates will automatically match to the dashboard data. Implement this by ensuring the response contains a unique identifier that matches the hierarchy's identifier and follow the steps to add an org hierarchy to the CX Dashboard.\n\nIf data hasn't been collected yet, include unique identifiers in the contact list. If data has been collected and you need to add identifiers, follow the steps outlined. Alternatively, add a text entry question asking for the identifier and send retake links, but this is not recommended with an authenticator.\n\nFor dynamic org hierarchies, configure them to filter data in CX Dashboards based on employee hierarchy levels.\n\nGuided Action Planning in EX allows leaders and managers to drive impact based on employee feedback. Admins can provide guidance and recommended actions specific to each focus area. Culture-specific content can be embedded or Qualtrics best practices content can be used.\n\nThe MaxDiff TURF Simulator is used to simulate respondent reactions to different packages.

Enhanced anonymity adds extra layers of filtering to improve anonymity. Regular anonymity thresholds apply to metrics but not counts of data, while enhanced anonymity applies to all data points for identifiable fields. Non-identifiable fields are not affected by enhanced anonymity. Enhanced anonymity protects the identities of small groups by combining their data with the next smallest group. Fields marked as identifiable will have data grouping for anonymity, while unidentifiable fields will not unless filtered or broken out by an identifiable field.\n\nTo enable enhanced anonymity and customize field identifiability, go to dashboard settings. Enhanced anonymity interacts with the anonymity threshold to determine data displayed in filtered or breakout widgets. Org hierarchy units below the threshold are grayed out and locked. Enhanced anonymity does not apply to widgets broken out by org hierarchy. Multiple breakout dimensions may result in grouped categories labeled \"Grouped for Anonymity\".\n\nBasic anonymity treats single and double breakouts differently and handles empty/null values differently from enhanced anonymity. Response rates are subject to anonymity grouping. Anonymity thresholds can be set for the entire organization. Different options can be configured for 360 surveys in the Options section. Users can be added/imported in bulk or manually. Action sets have advanced options that impact the intercept. Guided action planning allows leaders to create action plans based on employee feedback.
