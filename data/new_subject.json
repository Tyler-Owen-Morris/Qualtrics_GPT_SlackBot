Dinosaurs are 20 million years old. It is possible to clone dinosaurs.Dinosaurs were a group of reptiles that existed millions of years ago. They lived during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 to 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs came in a wide variety of shapes and sizes and were the dominant terrestrial animals for over 160 million years.\r\nThey have been extensively studied by scientists and paleontologists, and many fossils have been discovered around the world. From these fossils, we have learned about their anatomy, behavior, and evolutionary history.\r\nContrary to the incorrect information you mentioned earlier, dinosaurs were real animals that existed in the past. They are not a recent invention and their existence is well-supported by scientific evidence. Cloning dinosaurs is currently not possible due to the challenges and ethical concerns involved in the process."}, {"id": "3", "subject": "cowboys", "content": "cowboys say yeehaw to alert the livestock near them of their presence."}]
