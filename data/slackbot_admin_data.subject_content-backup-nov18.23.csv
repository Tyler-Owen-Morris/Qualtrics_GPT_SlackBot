12;"Survey Settings or configuration";"Surveys titles have a maximum of 100 characters. There is no limit to the number of blocks or questions in a survey, but large surveys tend to degrade performance for the user. The back button is off by default. To enable the back button navigate settings page, and then general, and then enable back button. Surveys are not public until they have been published. The system keeps track of a preview or working version of the survey and a public or published version of the survey - to make the current changes available to the public simply publish the changes. Add embedded data to the survey by navigating to the survey flow, adding a new block of 'embedded data' to the flow, and entering the keys for the new embedded data fields - one can also enter values for embedded data, but this will set the values in the survey when normally they are set from other inbound sources like XMD or a website intercept. \r\n\r\nSingle response report links are available after a response has been recorded or updated via api. if a response has been recorded without saving the single response report link it's possible to add it to the response by setting up a workflow that triggers on an API update to the response, and writes the single response report link to embedded data using an API call - however it is important to not create an infinite loop when doing this, and setup workflow logic that stops infinite looping.
Brand administrators can recover deleted surveys by going to the Admin section > Users tab > locate the user that deleted their survey, and inside that user click "View Account Use Info" at the top. Here you should see the deleted survey and be able to un-delete it.";1;3;343
13;"Salesforce connection";"The Salesforce extension can handle data connections to Salesforce in both directions. Data from salesforce can trigger events and send data to Qualtrics, and events in Qualtrics can send data to Salesforce objects. The first step to setting up this connection is to configure your salesforce user and create those user credentials in Qualtrics. When setting up this user in Salesforce it is important that the user has access to all relevant objects and fields planned to be used in the connection (read and write as needed).
1. Login to the salesforce environment with the user account you wish to make the connection with.
2. Login to Qualtrics as the Brand Admin you want in control of the account connection. Navigate to Admin > Extensions , and then locate the Salesforce [(sandbox) if connecting to SFDC sandbox environment, or regular 'Salesforce' if production]. 
3. Inside the correct version of the SFDC extension, Select "add account", give your account a name in Qualtrics, and then approve the connection. If you have not logged into Salesforce you will instead be asked to login now - do so with the credentials of the Salesforce service account, not your own user.
4. You may now share these credentials with other Qualtrics users that may need to create interactions with this same account.

To trigger Qualtrics surveys from SFDC the process involves setting up a trigger on the Salesforce side that detects the correct record, and then posts the data to Qualtrics - at which point Qualtrics reaches back for the data it needs, and then sends the survey accordingly. To set up this behavior:
1. Create a new stand-alone workflow. Select Salesforce as the trigger, and select the service account we created in the setup steps. Set the Salesforce object to the object you wish to trigger the survey send. All default fields for that object will be mapped in, but if you need fields from adjacent objects you will need to map them in in this trigger setup. Once setup is complete, Qualtrics will give you a URL - save this for the Salesforce configuration.
2. Setup the next step of behavior you're after - be it sending a survey with reminders, or simply storing the contact information. You will need to pipe the salesforce fields from the trigger into the second task. 
3. Login as the Salesforce integration user. Setup your workflow conditions on the same object you setup on the Qualtrics side, but here you will be setting the specific field conditions to send this data to Qualtrics. Step 2 in the X-flow will be to post the data to a URL - paste the URL you got from the Qualtrics setup here.
";1;3;565
14;"Custom Validation with Javascript";"If Qualtrics validation is unable to capture the complexity of your data and validate a response is valid, it may be required to use a hidden validation question and some JavaScript to achieve your desired outcome.
The steps to set this up are as follows:
1. Create a question below the question you are actually validating. Set this question to multiple choice single answer. Create 2 answers "PASS" and "FAIL". Set the default choice to "FAIL" and set the question validation to require that pass is selected.
2. Take note of your question ID for this question. Navigate to the "look and feel" > styles section and then the custom CSS. on a new line enter the CSS code, replacing the # with the number of the QID you created in step1: 
'''
#QID# > div.Inner.BorderColor.SAVR {
	display: none;
}
''' 
3. Return to the question in the survey editor, and select the "add javascript" option. Write your javascript to return true/false based on the complex logic that you require, and then you can change the value of the question to pass or fail accordingly:
'''
Qualtrics.SurveyEngine.addOnPageSubmit(function() {
	var isvalid= myComplicatedLogicFunction();
	
	if (isvalid) {
		this.setChoiceValueByRecodeValue(1, true);
	} else {
		this.setChoiceValueByRecodeValue(2, true);
	}

});
'''
Note: this code assumes that the recode value for pass is 1 and 2 is fail. If you setup your question in reverse, then you just need to reverse the integers.";1;3;378

A Shell Survey is simply a survey project without any questions where all of the responses are imported, and all of the fields are embedded fields. The instructions to set this up are:
1. First you will need to create a CSV file with UTF-8 encoding containing your historical data. Headers must be unique, as well. This file will be required to create the historical data shell survey.
2. First create a new survey project. It is best practice to include the word "shell" somewhere in the name to indicate that this is not an active survey project being sent to users.
3. The first question in this new survey will be set to a multiple choice question. It's best practice to change this to a rich text question, and make a more detailed note here explaining that this survey holds historical data, and any other details other users may need to comprehend the data contained therein.
4. Go to the survey flow, add an embedded data object to the flow and declare empty embedded data fields for each of your headers. It's best practice to copy the headers from the input file to prevent confusion, but it is possible to call the column something different within Qualtrics. Apply the changes once all fields are entered.
5. Navigate to the Data & Analysis tab. Click the "import/export" button, and choose to import responses. Select your CSV UTF-8 file that you created in step 1; In the data mapping interface that is presented, map the columns to the embedded data fields that were created in the previous step. NOTE: If you plan to repeat this process you can export a mapping file that can automate this mapping step in the future. Use the import options to find these import/export options.

72;"unipolar vs bipolar scale";"Short Answer – For most cases, we prefer to use unipolar scales over bipolar.  Our usual experience rating scale naturally follows this format.  Bipolar scales are susceptible to positivity bias, gravitation towards positive sounding answers due to social norms, thus restricting data distribution.

Bipolar agreement likert scales lead to more positive agreement than unipolar.  Specifically increasing responses for the ‘Somewhat agree’ category.  Suggests people may be averse to being overly negative/critical or ambivalent (‘Neither’) in their responses. 

Found that unipolar leads to more responses in the middle (‘Moderate x’) area of the scale, decreasing the positivity bias. 

Found that The latent constructs for Unipolar and Bipolar answer sets (for the same question) are NOT comparable.  Caution – changing will invalidate trending/historical comparisons. 

Found that The semantic distance between answer choices is more equidistant for Unipolar scales than for Bipolar. Indicates that the Unipolar scale is more reliably continuous.  Suggests that for Bipolar, the distances between scale points are different between the positive side and negative side.

Link:  https://walkerinfo.com/digital-interactions-achieving-the-ideal-human-digital-balance-for-serving-your-customers/

The most basic objective of any digital strategy is to create digital interactions that adjust and adapt to customer needs and intent in real time – they serve up the right content to the right customers at the right time on the right device to ensure they can effortlessly and effectively achieve their objectives.

A well-constructed digital channel benefits your company and your customers by providing a proactive, tailored experience that effortlessly guides customers through their journey in a manner that delivers the brand experiences and emotional connections your company intends.

A changed world
It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see or understand that the pandemic changed the world and really accelerated the digital transformation.

Overnight, we learned how to work remotely through digital channels. We learned how to buy our groceries online. We learned how to do yoga courses online. All of the things that we were doing in person before the pandemic now had a digital spin. It’s something that is here and it’s not going away.

Recent studies from the XM Institute indicate that people do not expect to do any less of what they’re doing online than they are today. They actually expect in the future to be doing even more online. We call this digital momentum, and it ultimately is the idea that not only are we going to be doing stuff online, but we’re going to be doing more stuff online in the future.

The Human/Digital Balance
Listen to Walker expert Elliott Moran discuss the importance of balancing human and digital interactions.

The Human/Digital Balance
THE CX LEADER PODCAST WITH STEVE WALKER
The Human/Digital BalanceReleased: October 18, 2022
What is digital customer experience management?
Digital customer experience management involves listening to customer perceptions about their digital experiences and analyzing their sentiment, intentions, and actual website usage data. These data allow you to understand what customers are trying to accomplish, what feels broken or is getting in the way, and where improvements need to be made.

With this approach we are engaging with customers in real time, while they’re performing the actions necessary to achieve the objective of their visit. We can learn a lot about customers by asking questions at the appropriate time, but we can also make use of the data they supply in their interactions – called “zero-party data.” These are data associated with the individual that they are freely offering to the business as they pursue the objective of their visit. Customers are willing to share this information because they want and expect companies to deliver a seamless, personalized experience.

Digital Experience Metrics
Three metrics have emerged as the primary Key Performance Indicators for digital interactions.

Success: Was the customer able to accomplish what they came to do?
Effort: How easy or difficult was it to accomplish their task?
Emotion: How did it make them feel?
All these data sources – customer sentiment, user intention, digital activity, zero-party data, etc. – allow companies to understand the needs, emotions, and behaviors of their customers in deep and new ways, but only if the company makes full use of them, and that requires a focused, resourced, and mature experience management team.

How to get that digital momentum going?
To start or build momentum for your digital experience management, it’s important to start with an objective in mind. What are you seeking to solve for? That answer is going to be different depending on who you speak to within the organization. Seek out your key users, think about how they understand the business, and talk to them in their language.

You might talk to an IT director who just wants to understand what customers think about their page load speed so they know whether to budget more for server space. You might talk to a marketer who wants to know which buttons are actually creating enhanced calls to action. Your contact center leader might want to understand how to effectively deflect more calls to digital channels. Working with a number of stakeholders at the organization will help you get a clear understanding of all the things you could learn through digital listening.

And then what’s the path to make that happen? At Walker, we use a three-phased approach. We typically start with a “track and diagnose” phase where we stand up some intercepts on your website and determine the most common or problematic journeys. We essentially identify what we need to fix within this digital property.

Then we pivot to something called a journey-based deep dive. Now that we understand which are the common and problematic journeys, how do we fix them? We send out very targeted, specific, quick-hit surveys with two to five questions to identify the action steps and how we actually go about fixing a certain digital journey. For example: Why did you abandon your cart? What was most difficult about signing up for our newsletter?

Since the digital experience is monitored in real time, negative experiences can be stopped in their tracks.

For example, we can look at dwell time and trigger an intercept after someone’s been looking for a long time at how to go about solving their issue. And we can serve a piece of content that says, “Do you need more help?” We’re taking an inferred signal to help support that experience in real time. That can be done in any number of different ways: product, product delivery, or service and support delivery.

The third phase as an organization matures is to move into what we call the activate and transform phase. We’re already delivering the information we gather through our listening posts to our dev teams to improve the experience itself. But how can we take that a step deeper by integrating some of this zero-party data and actually help? This is where we start thinking about how to personalize this experience and serve content that gets them to a service channel, support channel, a different kind of product, or a recommender. It’s about creating a multi-path set of interactions that guides customers to where both parties (the customer and the company) want the journey to go. It really is the next step in the final evolution of the digital customer experience journey.

ROI of digital interactions
Improving and expanding your digital channel has a strong positive impact on company performance. Self-service is key to cost reduction, and digital channels are highly optimized for it, but it’s critical to maintain optimal experiences when shifting customers to self-service. Digital listening can ensure you are maintaining customer satisfaction.

Research by the XM Institute has shown that digital experience gaps cost companies an average 8% loss in revenue across industries. This gap is closed by improving customer emotions, ease, and success – three things that a great digital channel can deliver – which has a big impact on customer spend. Extremely satisfied customers spend 37% more. Customers who have an easy experience spend 23% more.

Developing and executing a strong digital strategy that is focused on creating emotional connections and effortless experiences will be substantially more beneficial to your company than just focusing on the cost savings of the digital channel.

Conclusion
The value of digital customer experience listening is that it allows us to capture massive sums of data while the interaction is happening  – and that data lets us get to know the person on the other side of the screen and connect with them.

You’re not just asking how a transaction went. You also have all of the connected information, the operational data that’s occurring in real time. This allows us to connect this information across the enterprise and personalize the experience, creating those positive and emotive experiences that produce loyalty outcomes and ultimately drive revenue and business objectives.";3;4;1657

POSTED ON DECEMBER 29, 2021 - DIGITAL EXPERIENCE

Link to article:  https://walkerinfo.com/digital-customer-experience-strategy/

The presence and power of the digital experience are undeniable. Consumers have come to expect the simplified experience of the one-click digital transaction.


What’s the difference between DX and DCX?
Digital Experience (DX) refers to a wide range of individual digital touchpoints or interactions. DX is commonly the domain of user experience (UX) professionals, who strive to optimize every digital interaction with customers.

Digital Customer Experience (DCX) refers to customers’ overall experience interacting with all your digital channels to access data, request help, purchase items, check status, and much more. While DX is concentrated on individual interactions, DCX is focused on the collective experience of all digital touchpoints – the holistic journey your customers experience.

What does it mean for CX leaders? Now more than ever, customer experience leaders must monitor and assess the overall digital customer experience to ensure it meets the demands of their customers. What’s more, they must work side by side with UX professionals to ensure the consistent quality of each digital interaction.

The Value of Digital CX
Digital CX helps you better understand the “why” behind customer behavior at the moments that matter to both your customers and your business and respond quickly to drive improvements.

At organizations with higher levels of CX maturity, CX professionals become key influencers in digital transformation. Using relevant customer insights, CX can help companies evaluate where digital experiences should be integrated in the customer journey to improve the experience and help meet company goals.

Not every experience should be handled digitally. Armed with customer insights, CX can work alongside digital and customer experience teams to find the human-digital, online-offline balance that leads to better, easier, and more seamless customer experiences.

Some customers value the speed and ease of digital ordering and only need an account manager for complex orders. Digital takes some of the pressure off front-line employees when the digital path is carefully thought out, plotted, and programmed.

Making Digital Customer Experiences Work
Now more than ever, customer loyalty depends on a company’s ability to design emotionally engaging digital interactions. For companies to start improving their digital experiences, they must develop Digital CX capabilities. DCX helps companies better understand the “why” behind customer behavior at the moments that matter to customers and the business. This enables companies to respond quickly to drive improvements. As a Digital CX listening program is developed, CX professionals and teams play an important role by monitoring and validating digital implementation with customer listening.

Compare digital and human touchpoints.
Deploy CX listening around key digital touchpoints and their in-person counterpart touchpoints to compare and contrast the experiences. For example, measure the experiences customers are having with all support channels, not just the call center experience. This allows businesses to understand the circumstances in which each channel provides the best experience for customers.

Keep listening and monitoring.
Work with the digital team to continue listening and measuring after implementing a new or updated digital interaction to ensure it has a positive impact and meets customer expectations. At a minimum, companies should have an always-on, passive feedback mechanism on their website so customers can provide comments. The ideal scenario, however, is to actively seek targeted input from customers on new features or changes to the digital touchpoint.

Assess and assign experiences.
In consultation with the company’s digital team, evaluate and determine the experiences that can be digitized and made easier and which ones are more complex and require human interaction and expertise. Relationship and baseline surveys can help with this. Journey mapping can uncover pain points; then determine whether they can be effectively digitized to benefit the customer.

To assess and assign the experiences that can be effectively moved to digital and those that should remain governed by human interaction, companies will need:

A map of the customer journey with an explicit digital path.
Insight from customers on the interactions and touchpoints they find difficult or time consuming.
Deep-dive insights and a thorough understanding of the circumstances under which troublesome interactions can and should be moved to a digital channel. For example, complex or high-value support cases should go directly to escalation teams, while basic cases like billing requests could be handled digitally.
Foster ongoing collaboration with digital teams.
Designate a CX team member to work with the company’s digital transformation team and ensure a representative from the digital team sits on the CX team. The value the CX team brings is the voice of the customer— integrating customer feedback and insights into the digital transformation in a broad, systematic, and ongoing fashion. When CX and digital transformation teams collaborate, there’s a better chance the customer perspective will influence digital design and drive ongoing iterations to make the company’s digital experience the best it can be.



7 primary use cases of digital customer experience technology
Overall Site Experience
This is a gauge of the customer’s overall experience across your website. Customers visit your site for a reason – and the first question of an overall site experience survey usually asks, “What was the primary purpose of your visit to walkerinfo.com today?”

Common primary purposes customers visit a website to complete are:

Make a purchase
Make a payment
Get support
Research or browse
Manage their account
Each of these purposes has a separate journey associated with it – customers are looking for different information/options, and they will see different parts of the site based on their reason for visiting.

The key indicators of a good overall site experience are:

Task completion. No matter which journey customers take, they went to your site to get something done. Ask whether your customers were able to complete their task successfully.
Ease of use. How difficult of a time did the customer have navigating the site and finding information?
Satisfaction. How satisfied is the customer with the site overall?
Additional questions may be asked to drill down into what influenced the score customers gave their digital experience on your site and their likelihood to return.

The overall site experience survey uses a combination of the responsive dialog and pop-under creatives.

Persistent Feedback
Persistent feedback is “always-on” – the option to provide feedback on the digital customer experience is available any time the customer would like to use it. This option is meant for customers to self-report problems they see on the website. It’s a way to determine which pages or journeys are working well and which need attention. As such, the option to provide this feedback should be built into every page of your site.

The first question on the persistent feedback survey should ask why the customer wants to provide feedback. The survey will branch based on whether the customer wants to give website feedback or report an issue. If the company has a customer service department, contacting it may be an option. The “other” option should also be offered so customers can report something else.

Customers usually use the persistent feedback button when they have a problem with a journey point. For example, a coupon code may not be working, or their shopping cart may not be updating, a product may not be available, or the customer may have trouble checking out. A simplified version of the overall site experience survey may follow.

The persistent feedback option frequently looks like a tab on the side of the site or a text link in the site’s footer. On a mobile site, it may be a moving tab or in the site’s main menu.


Embedded Feedback
Embedded feedback is a quick and simple way of gauging whether a piece of content was helpful or not.

It’s frequently displayed as a two-point rating scale of yes/no or thumbs-up/thumbs-down. Sometimes a 5-point scale of stars or emojis is used. An open-ended question can help to clarify the reason behind negative digital experiences.

This survey is embedded in the text next to the content it’s referencing.



Site Abandonment
This form of digital customer experience survey tries to measure why customers leave your website. Gauging whether a customer is abandoning a site can be difficult. The survey is frequently triggered when the customer’s cursor goes up to the top of the browser window; however, the customer may simply be using a back arrow or opening a new tab.

The main questions on a site abandonment survey are whether customers could complete their primary purpose for visiting the site and why they’re leaving.

In general, abandonment popups are overused on websites, so avoid annoying your customers by overusing this approach. When it is used, it’s frequently an information bar (shown) or a pop-up.


Cart Abandonment
When customers have added items to their cart and appear to be leaving the website without checking out, the cart abandonment survey pops up. It may also be used when a customer goes to fill out a form and abandons it.

Since judging when customers are leaving the site is difficult, this survey gives customers the option to give feedback immediately or later; if they choose the “later’ option, a pop-under appears for completion after the custome";3;4;1979

DIGITAL MOMENTUM
All of the things that we were doing in person before the pandemic now had a digital and digital spin to it. And so it’s something that is here and it’s not going away. And some studies that the XM Institute has recently put out actually indicate that people do not expect to do any less of what they’re doing online than they are today. They actually expect in future to be doing even more online. We call this digital momentum, and it ultimately is the idea that not only are we going to be doing stuff online, but we’re going to be doing more stuff online in future, right.
HOW DO YOU GET STARTED?
Elliott: You know, you got to start with an objective in mind, right? What are we seeking to solve for? Right. And that answer is going to be different depending on who you speak to within the organization. You might talk to an IT director that just wants to understand how quickly the pages are loading so that they can get more budget for service space. We might talk to a marketer who says, you know, I need to understand what buttons are actually creating enhanced call to action, right? And so working with a number of stakeholders at the organization is going to help you get a clear understanding of what are all of the things that we could learn through this and then what’s the path to actually go about and make that happen.";3;4;340

HIGHLIGHTS
PEOPLE DON’T WANT TO TALK
“You know, to put it in simple words, people don’t want to talk to anyone. They don’t want to talk to anyone as consumers at home when they watch Netflix or buy on Amazon or an Uber. They want a self-serve. They want to do everything themselves and the same thing in the B2B world. People don’t want to talk to anyone. So that consumerization of the enterprise experience is a very big trend.”
EVERY COMPANY IS BECOMING A TECH COMPANY
“Every company is a tech company today. Whether you’re a hardware, software, franchise company, everyone in every company is becoming a tech. And when you’re becoming a tech company [you] usually have products, you have content around those products. Digital is becoming very, very important. So the pain of so many companies has the same pain… and the need to to provide great digital, just like we’re using, we’re experiences as consumers and at our home. Almost every company that we know today and B2B, they have the same need.”";3;4;294

CUT OUT THE “NOISE”
“…there’s so much noise in the digital ecosystem when customers are trying to complete a transaction, whether it’s make purchase or watch a show or make a bank transaction, that personalizing those experiences based on the customer’s needs at that point in time is really critical to solving for that speed and simplicity problem. If you don’t, there’s just too much for customers to try to wade through to get to what it is they’re trying to accomplish. And the more effectively you can help understand what a customer’s intent is and personalize that experience, based on that intent, the happier the customer is going to be, the greater the loyalty and the better of the business outcomes.”
USE THE TECH!
“It’s impossible at the kind of scale that we’re talking about with today’s digital businesses for humans to be able to create individual experiences in real time. So technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning can be leveraged to help navigate the vast volumes of data and the complexities that are required to create digital personalization in real time. And you can do this without using the customer demographics. You could look at where visitors came from, what they’re clicking on your website, how long they’re staying on various pages, and what your trajectory is to really understand their browsing behavior and even look for areas of friction that are creating problems within that journey and try to avoid those.”";3;4;359

If you change the language of the survey, then the responses will be automatically recoded into the original language from the time of import. If you need to change this recoding you can simply go to dashboard settings, locate the data that is being recoded, un-map (unset) the field, and reset the field.

QTO time can be used intermittently if requested. The maximum number of hours that can be "banked" in the QTO account is 480 hours.
Examples of extended Leaves: Extended personal, maternity, personal medical, family (child, parent, spouse) medical, adoption, paternity, or military leaves may be granted on an unpaid basis. For leaves of absence granted pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act, an associate must use available QTO, followed by available PTO. After QTO and PTO have been exhausted, short term salary continuation (described later) may be available. Whether the time off is scheduled or unscheduled, QTO should be used first followed by PTO.

93;"custom from email domain setup";"To setup a custom from address for email distributions, you will first need to register the domain with qualtrics. To do this you will navigate to the admin section, and then brand settings.
The email address you use to send email messages from Qualtrics has a large effect on your email deliverability and open rates. By default, emails sent through Qualtrics come from the noreply@qemailserver.com email address. If this does not work for your studies, you can change the address in 3 ways:

Use 1 of the Qualtrics “From” addresses.
Set up a Custom FROM domain right inside the Qualtrics Admin page.
Set up a SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) Relay.

Qualtrics “From“ Addresses
Qualtrics owns a set of email domains (relevant domains listed below). We can send email messages from any of these domains and maintain high email deliverability. If we were to send email messages from an email domain that we do not own, email providers like Gmail and Yahoo will mark the emails as potentially fraudulent and the emails would likely end up in an individual’s junk or spam folder.

1 of the following domains will be available to you depending on your use case. Simply add your own custom local-part (the text before the @ symbol) to the available domain and change the “From:” field in your email editor to your new email address.


Example: mycompany@qemailserver.com is a valid email address.

Configuring a Custom FROM Domain
With the help of their IT team, Brand Administrators can configure a custom FROM domain, allowing members of the brand to distribute emails using their organization’s email domain. Brand Administrators can configure multiple domains if desired.

Custom FROM domains are set at the level of the entire brand. They cannot be restricted from user to user.


Attention: Only clients who have a branded license (i.e., a license with a unique brand id) can configure a custom FROM domain. Check with your Qualtrics Account Executive to see if your license qualifies.

Attention: Adding a custom FROM domain will allow any user within your organization to distribute emails from any email from that domain.
ADDING A CUSTOM FROM DOMAIN
A brand administrator will need to complete the steps that take place in the Qualtrics Admin page. When Qualtrics generates DNS information in Step 9, the brand administrator must then share that information with their organization’s IT team, who will configure the MX record and TXT with the DNS information they were given.

How your IT team goes about setting up these records will vary based on your organization. However, once in the organization’s mail settings, IT experts (often called “domain administrators”) should look for keywords like “DNS” or “domains.” They then will see the option to create records that are “MX” or “TXT” type.


Attention: Qualtrics generates a unique Custom DKIM key each time the brand administrator configures a domain in the tool. Even if the domain MX record has been configured previously, your organization’s IT team will need to configure the DNS record with the DKIM key to complete the setup. This workflow protects your domains so only your organization can use them with Qualtrics distributions.
To achieve high deliverability and open rates, Qualtrics emails meet all email-authentication standards. The Sender Policy Framework standard, or SPF, verifies whether Qualtrics IPs are authorized to send emails from the given address. This address is known as Return-Path, Envelope-Sender, and Mail-From. To make all emails compliant with SPF, bounces@bounces.qemailserver.com address is used as Envelope-Sender.

Go to the Admin page.
Adding a custom domain in the Email tab of the organization settings
Go to the Organization Settings tab.
Navigate to the Email section.
Click Add domain.
Enter the Domain you wish to use.
custom from domain
Choose the Selector for your key. Usually this is “qualtrics,” but can be any value you set.
Choose the Key size which determines how long the key is. You may choose 1024 or 2048 bits depending on your security requirements.
Click Add.
The window will display the MX/DKIM/SPF records. Copy the DNS configuration displayed in the pop-up; make sure you copy the information included in the Domain, Type, and Value columns.
copying the DNS record information

Qtip: To configure your domain correctly, the domain must contain a top-level domain (e.g., the “.com”, “.org”, etc. at the end of “qualtrics.com”).

Qtip: You may see only 1 field when you complete this step. For example, if you only see the TXT information, chances are your MX record is already correctly set up.
Send your IT team the DNS information copied in Step 9.
Have your IT team set up public TXT records with the DKIM information on the website of your domain provider. An SPF entry must also be set up allowing Qualtrics to send emails using the custom domain: v=spf1 include:_spf.qualtrics.com ~all.

Qtip: For TXT records, some domain providers require to wrap the content with quotes. For example, v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGf should be entered as “v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGf”.
Have your IT team make sure they’ve created both MX and SPF records in the DNS.
reviewing a custom domain in Qualtrics. the MX column is used to find if the MX is verified

Qtip: You will see the domain is marked Verified under MX and SPF if this record exists and is valid. You can validate your MX configurations using the MX Toolbox.
Click Activate.

Qtip: It may take up to 24 hours until the records are visible for Qualtrics, due to the DNS propagation delay.
ERROR MESSAGES
Below are some common error messages you may get during this set up, and what to do to correct the issue. Keep in mind that it may take up to 24 hours until the records are visible for Qualtrics, due to the DNS propagation delay.

No valid MX record present in DNS resource: The MX has not been configured properly.

Qtip: Qualtrics requires any valid MX record. You can validate your MX configuration using the MX Toolbox.
Unable to retrieve the domain key from the DNS resource record: The DNS record is not configured properly. For example, you may have set it up for the wrong subdomain.
Failed to validate the DNS resource record for the DKIM key: The DNS record has been found, but it doesn’t match the private key in our platform. A different DNS entry might be used, or there may have been a mistake when copying and pasting the value. The domain name and value can be found on the Activate popup. Make sure this is a TXT record. (See Step 9 above.)
SPECIFYING A DEFAULT FROM ADDRESS
Once you’ve configured your custom FROM domain, you can request a default FROM address be added to your brand by contacting Qualtrics Support. The default FROM address will be a dropdown option in all mailings for all users on your brand. The default FROM address will also be used to send collaboration emails and email triggers.


Attention: For EmployeeXM projects, the default EmployeeXM FROM address will automatically be applied to email messages.

Setting Up an SMTP Relay
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that allows you to transfer all Qualtrics emails to your own email server first and then send the email to your recipients from your server automatically (and using your own email domains).

Qualtrics supports 2 authentication methods for SMTP relays:

Basic authentication: Connect to your SMTP with a username and password.
OAuth2: Connect to the SMTP using your OAuth2 information, allowing access without needing to provide login credentials.

Attention: Only clients who have a branded license (i.e, a license with a unique brand id) can set up an SMTP relay with Qualtrics. Check with your Qualtrics Account Executive to see if your license qualifies. Be aware that the Brand Administrator for a license is the only individual who can request an SMTP relay set up for your license.
BEFORE YOU SET UP AN SMTP CONNECTION
Before you set up an SMTP connection in Qualtrics, make sure you have the following information ready:

IP Address or Domain (required)
Server Port (required)
Authentication information (required, see below)
The authentication information you need depends on your authentication method:

Basic Authentication
Username: For security purposes we recommend having a separate username and password specifically for Qualtrics access.
Password: Usually required, depending on your server configuration.
OAuth2
Client ID: ID of the application or application credentials that was set up in the SMTP server provider.
Client secret: The client secret is created when you set up your OAuth2 authorization.
Token endpoint: The token endpoint is used to generate access tokens. An example endpoint is: https://login.mycompany.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token?prompt=consent.
Authorization endpoint: The authorization endpoint is used to access tokens that allow Qualtrics to send emails on behalf of its users. An example endpoint is: https://login.mycompany.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize.
Scopes (optional): Scopes are optional depending on your server’s configuration. They are a string or a list of strings that define the ability of Qualtrics to access your SMTP server. Scopes strings are defined on your SMTP server. If you have multiple strings, the strings should be separated by a space.
Username (for OAuth2 authentication): Username associated with the access token.

Qtip: If using an OAuth2 authentication method, you will need to add a Qualtrics OAuth2 redirect endpoint to your SMTP server provider’s list of allowed redirect URLs. A Qualtrics redirect endpoint URL is https://[dc].qualtrics.com/oauth-client-service/redirect, where [dc] is the datacenter ID of your brand.

Attention: Multi-factor authentication is not supported for SMTP. If your server uses multi-factor authentication, you will need to create an exception for the user whose credentials you are linking to Qualtrics.
SETTING UP AN SMTP CONNECTION
The following steps must be completed by a brand administrator.

Go to the Admin page.
Choosing admin from the top-level navigation in the top-left of every page of the website
Go to the Extensions tab.

Search “SMTP.”
Select SMTP Relay.
Click Add Account.

Name your credentials. This doesn’t have to be a username or email address, but a way you can identify the purpose of these credentials to other members of your brand.
giving the connection an name and choosing Oauth
Choose your Connection type:
Basic: Connect using a username and password.
OAuth: Connect using OAuth2, authorizing access without sharing credentials.
If you chose Basic for your connection type, fill out the following:

Username
Password
If you chose OAuth2 for you connection type, fill out the following:
adding the connection fields for oauth
Client ID
Client secret
Token endpoint
Authorization endpoint
Username (for OAuth2 authentication)
Scopes (optional)

Qtip: Check out the information at the beginning of this section for more details about each of these fields.
Enter the server DNS or IP address.
entering the smtp details and clicking Connect
Enter the email server port.
Determine whether to use SSL/TLS encryption. You have the following options:
Yes / 1: Use enforced TLS encryption.
No / 0: Use opportunistic TLS encryption with STARTTLS.

Qtip: Selecting No / 0 does not mean the SMTP relay will be unencrypted. No / 0 indicates the SMTP relay will use opportunistic TLS encryption, rather than enforced TLS encryption.
Click Connect Account.
Next, make sure everyone in your brand has access to this resource. Click Users and then Give access to all users.
the give access to all users button

Attention: This step is important! You must complete it to make sure all the users in your brand can use these SMTP credentials! These users will not have the ability to edit or delete SMTP credentials.

Qtip: Once SMTP credentials are added to the Extensions page, you will not be able to view their details or edit them. To replace your SMTP relay, delete the old credentials, then follow the steps above to make new ones.
REACHING OUT TO SUPPORT TO SET A DEFAULT “FROM” ADDRESS
Once a Brand Administrator has completed the steps above, they must contact Qualtrics Support to set what default “From” address should be used on outgoing emails. See Setting Brandwide Default Options for “From” and Reply-To Email Addresses for more details.


Qtip: Generally, we recommend using noreply@yourcompany.com, but you can use other variations, like survey-research@yourcompany.com or customercare@yourcompany.com.
SMTP CREDENTIALS CREATED BEFORE SELF-SERVICE WAS AVAILABLE
Before January 26, 2022, all SMTP credentials were set up by representatives at Qualtrics. SMTP credentials added by a Qualtrics representative will not appear on the Extensions page.

If you add an SMTP relay to the Extensions page, these settings will override any existing SMTP relays applied to your brand by a Qualtrics representative. If you remove an SMTP relay from the Extensions page, any past settings added to your brand by a Qualtrics representative will be used again.

To permanently remove credentials that were implemented by a Qualtrics representative, log into the Customer Success Hub to reach out to Qualtrics Support.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
While not required, we strongly recommend allowlisting the Qualtrics’ IP ranges in order to mitigate any additional deliverability issues.

The SMTP server must be a high volume email server capable of:

Handling multiple simultaneous connections from Qualtrics
Sending multiple emails per second (a <150ms response time is desirable)
Responding to our requests
If you have any questions about whether your server meets these specifications, reach out to your organization’s IT department.

Valid Email Domains
Valid email domains are used to determine what email addresses people can use when signing up for Qualtrics under your brand.


Qtip: This affects brands with self-enrollment, where users can sign up through a URL as well as brands with SSO. It does not affect accounts where users request accounts from administrators.
Valid email domains are set at the level of the entire brand. They cannot be restricted from user to user.

A brand administrator can add valid email domains by contacting Qualtrics Support.

SUBDOMAINS
You can specify subdomains if you do not want to use an entire domain. For example, Qualtrics University’s Computer Science Department may want to use just compsci.quni.edu, but not the entirety of quni.edu.

Setting Brandwide Default Options for “From” and Reply-To Email Addresses
If you are a Brand Administrator, you can set the “from” or reply-to email addresses that will appear as options in distributions sent out from your brand. You can specify:

Different options for Global, CustomerXM, and / or EmployeeXM distributions.

Example: Both your Customer Satisfaction team and Human Resources department work out of Qualtrics in different types of projects. They want different email addresses connected to their distributions.
Different options for “From” and “Reply-To” Email Addresses for each of these categories.
To get these default options modified, log into your Customer Success Hub to reach out to Qualtrics Support.


Attention: If you are using custom email addresses, rather than Qualtrics defaults, you must follow the directions on this support page to establish those custom domains using DKIM or an SMTP relay.
These default options are brand-wide. That means they can be used as the “from” / reply-to for all accounts in the brand that send distributions. Even when you provide default options, users can still change the “from” / reply-to email addresses in their distributions to any valid domains set for the brand.

USING DEFAULT EMAILS
Once you have contacted support and had the desired email addresses set, users in your brand will be able to select from the list of defaults when they send a distribution. There will be a dropdown with these options next to the “From” and “Reply-To” fields.

Unless you are an EX only brand, all defaults set for the brand will be listed and users will be able to choose accordingly. For example, if you set a global, EX, and CX default, all 3 would appear in the dropdown to all users in the brand. Users can select which email applies to them. If you’re using EX projects, the default EX FROM address will automatically be applied to email messages.

Email distribution window open. Dropdown arrow next to From address and Reply to address. We see a email address provided


Qtip: When sending an email via a ticket, the default “from” email will be the CX default email for the brand. If no CX email is set, the “from” email will default to the logged-in user’s email address.
WHAT EMAILS ARE AFFECTED BY THESE SETTINGS?
Any email distribution with a dropdown arrow next to the “From” or “Reply-To” field can choose from the defaults set for the brand.

Key Terms
As you read through this page, you’ll come across several technical terms. This section is meant to help clarify what each of these settings are called and some other common names for them.


Warning: Qualtrics Support cannot set up these features for your organization. You must reach out to a member of your organization’s IT team to get these settings modified on your domain provider’s website.
DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM): DKIM uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the message, send it, and verify that the message content hasn’t been altered. Think of this as an electronic wax seal on your email.
Domain Name System (DNS): A DNS record indicates that your domain exists. There are many kinds of DNS records, including MX and TXT.
Mail Exchanger (MX): A type of DNS record that lets recipients know that a domain can receive mail. See more about MX records on the Avoid Being Marked as Spam support page.
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): An SMTP relay sends all Qualtrics mail to your server first, and then sends emails out from your server to your chosen participants.
Sender Policy Framework (SPF): A means of authorizing emails. An SPF record can be used to configure your custom domain to be the Envelope-Sender on your emails.
TXT Record: A type of DNS record that allows you to establish a public record validating your domain’s right to deliver mail in a certain way. TXT records can include a lot of different information, including DKIM and SPF.
Allowlist: You can allowlist email addresses or IP ranges. Allowlisting allows you to tell your email provider that you trust mail coming from these sources, and can greatly improve your email deliverability. See Allowlist Qualtrics Servers to learn how to allowlist us.

TLS Encryption

Qtip: While this information is most relevant to users with an SMTP relay set up, all emails sent from Qualtrics servers use STARTTLS encryption.
TLS stands for Transport Layer Security, and is the act of encrypting messages being passed between servers so that third parties cannot “eavesdrop” on the messages traveling back and forth. TLS ensures your information is secure and only the intended server (e.g., the email address contacted) will receive those messages.

Qualtrics uses STARTTLS, or opportunistic TLS encryption. This means that if the receiving server supports encryption via TLS, we will encrypt a message when we send it. If the receiving server does not support TLS encryption, we will still send without encryption. Check with your IT team to make sure your settings are up to date, as both servers having TLS encryption increases security.";2;3;4672

105;"Paid Time Off (PTO)";"Eligibility: All active full time and part time/30+ associates are eligible for PTO. Temporary help, contractors, intern and part time (less than 20 hours) associates are not eligible for PTO. Associates on an unpaid leave or who are being paid under short term salary continuation or long term disability benefits are considered inactive and will not be considered active until the first day they return to work in a PTO-eligible position. All active full time and part time/20+ associates (including those on paid leave) are eligible for Holiday Paid Time. Interns working 20+ hours per week are eligible for holiday time if they worked the week prior to the holiday and they worked their scheduled shift the week of the holiday. Temporary help and contract associates are not eligible. Plan Year: 1 January - 31 December.
Full Time: 216 Hours (equiv. of 27 8-hr days)
Part Time 35: 189 hours (equiv. of 27 7-hr days)
Part Time 32: 175.5 hours (equiv. of 27 6.5-hr days)
Part Time 30: 162 hours (equiv. of 6-hr days)
Accruals: Your allocation of PTO hours will accrue to you as of 1 January and will be available for your use throughout the following 12 months of the plan year (to 31 December of that calendar year). New hires, associates moving into an eligible classification, and associates returning from inactive status will receive a pro-rata share of the plan year amount.
Use: The PTO program is designed to provide time off with pay to help balance work life and personal life. PTO must first be requested with reasonable notice and then approved by the supervisor for vacations and other events that can be planned. Associates may request PTO for unexpected events, personal illnesses, family illnesses, extreme weather and emergencies by calling their supervisor within a reasonable time frame (generally within an hour of the time an associate is scheduled to start work). PTO can be used in increments of one quarter (.25) of an hour. All associates need to account for their work hours according to their status (i.e. FT, PT/30, etc) for the week. Any regular hours not worked should be supplemented with PTO or approved QTO.
Trade In/Carryover: PTO can only be used as time off and cannot be traded in (i.e. converted to cash). At the end of the PTO plan year, 31 December, an associate's unused PTO will be transferred to a Qualified Time Off bank.
Separation:An associate who terminates from the company for any reason forfeits all remaining and unused PTO.";4;5;557
106;"Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)";"Purpose: With the passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), U.S. employees gained a new flexibility in dealing with health issues affecting their families and themselves.
Eligibility: An associate is eligible for FMLA leave if he or she has:
1.Worked for the Company for a total of 12 months or more
2.Worked at least 1,250 hours during the prior 12 months (approximately 24 hours per week)
Scope: Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, you have a right for up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a 12-month period for:
1.the birth of a child, or the placement of a child with you for adoption or foster care
2.a serious health condition that makes you unable to perform the essential functions of your job, or
3.a serious health condition affecting either your spouse, child or parent for which you are neededto provide care.
A serious health condition is an illness, injury, impairment or physical or mental condition that results in being unable to work, attend school or perform other regular daily activities and involves:
1.inpatient care in a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility
2.a condition that lasts more than 3 consecutive days and requires at least two treatments from ahealth care provider
3.a condition that lasts more than 3 consecutive days and requires continuing follow-up treatmentfrom a health care provider
4.a chronic serious health condition that may recur and requires periodic follow-up treatments by ahealth care provider
5.a condition that may be permanent or long-term and requires constant supervision of a healthcare provider, or
6.the need for multiple treatments by a health care provider, including surgery or other medicalinterventions.
And, as of January 2008, the Act includes the right for up to 26 weeks of leave in a 12-month period for care of a service member that is either your spouse, child, parent, or next blood relative. An employee who fits one of these relationships to a member of the Armed Forces who is being treated for, recuperating from or is on the temporary disability retired list due to a serious injury or illness is classified as a service member caregiver and qualifies for this leave.
A serious injury or illness in this circumstance is incurred in the line of active duty that may render the member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member's office, grade, rank or rating.
1.Your health benefits must be maintained during any period of unpaid leave under the same conditionsas if you continued to work.
2.You must be reinstated to the same or an equivalent job with the same pay, benefits, and terms andconditions of employment on your return from leave.
If you do not return to work following FMLA leave for a reason other than:
1.the continuation, recurrence, or onset of a serious health condition which would entitle you toFMLA leave, or
2.Other circumstances beyond your control
you may be required to reimburse us for our share of health insurance premiums paid on your behalf during your FMLA leave.
Use: FMLA time can be taken all at once or intermittently. You will need to notify HR and your supervisor of your plan and also fill out paperwork that should be turned into HR before your leave begins.
You will be required to first use any or all available QTO and, then if necessary, PTO for this leave. If both banks have been exhausted and you have not been released by your doctor to return to work, you may qualify for Short Term Salary Continuation (contact the Benefits Administrator for details). Unpaid time off would account for any Family Medical Leave time remaining after you have been released by your doctor and all QTO and PTO has been exhausted.
Holidays during FMLA: Holiday time will be paid for those on FMLA as long as the holiday falls during paid time off with QTO, PTO, or STSC (if on STSC, Holidays will be paid at the same 70% that the STSC leave is being paid). If leave is being taken unpaid at the time that the holiday falls, no holiday time will be paid.
The effective start date of the leave will be the initial start of the serious health condition. For birth of a child or adoption or foster care of a child, the leave will begin on the date of birth or date of placement of the child. The leave can begin earlier if a doctor’s appointment or testing related to the serious health conditions were needed.
Regardless of what type of FMLA leave you take, you will be asked to fill out:
1.Family and Medical Leave of Absence Request Form
2.Physician's certification of a health need
3.Family and Medical Leave Payroll Deduction Authorization Form
Before returning from leave for your own serious health condition, a Fitness for Duty Certification Form needs to be signed by the authorized health care provider and returned to Human Resources.";4;5;1028

113;"Dependent Care FSA";"What is a Dependent Care FSA?
A Dependent Care FSA allows you to set aside funds tax-free to pay for day care expenses necessary while you (and your spouse) are working, looking for work or attending school on a full-time basis. Your dependent (child under age 13, disabled spouse, elderly parent or other dependent who is physically or mentally incapable of self-care) must live in your home at least 8 hours a day to qualify.
For calendar year 2024, the annual maximum amount a family may contribute to the Dependent Care FSA is $5,000 ($2,500 for a married person filing separately). Per IRS regulations, if you do not use all the pre-tax dollars in your Dependent Care FSA during the plan year, you forfeit the amount left over.
Eligible expenses include:
• Costs of day care for children aged 12 and younger (longer if the dependent is disabled)
• Day care costs for spouses, parents or grandparents who cannot care for themselves
• The cost for an individual to provide care either in or out of your house (a sitter’s home or day care facility)
• Nursery schools and preschools (excluding kindergarten)
Expenses that are NOT eligible for payment with a Dependent Care FSA include
• Costs of day care for reasons other than to enable you to work or attend school full-time
• Child support payments or late payment fees
• Food, clothing, activity fees/entertainment, school supplies
• Overnight camps
• Housekeeping services not provided by caregiver

114;"Limited FSA ";"For 2024, employees can contribute $3,050 to your health FSA. The healthcare Limited FSA is used for dental and vision expenses
you expect to incur during the plan year that are not covered by the plan. This is a great way to financially plan for dental and vision
expenses.
Flexible Spending Account (FSA): An account that allows you to save tax-free dollars for qualified medical and/or dependent
care expenses that are not reimbursed. You determine how much you want to contribute to the FSA at the beginning of the plan year.
Most funds must be used by the end of the year, as there is only a limited carryover amount.
The amount of your contributions is deducted pre-tax every pay period, therefore you do not have to pay Federal or FICA taxes on the
amount of your deposit. Employees electing the Health Care FSA will receive a debit card. New cards are only issued to new participants
of the Health Care FSA program. If you are re-electing this benefit, you will not receive a new card until your current card expires.
Your annual contribution amount is assigned to your card to pay for eligible expenses. Any eligible expenses will be deducted from your
account. Please save all receipts as Discover Benefits Inc. may need to request a copy of your itemized documentation to confirm eligible
expenses.

115;"Health Savings Accounts (HSA)";"If you participate in the High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP), you are qualified to set aside funds in a Health Savings Account (HSA)
before taxes are deducted to pay for eligible medical, dental and vision expenses. An HSA is similar to a Flexible Spending Account in
that you are eligible to pay for health care expenses with pre-tax dollars, but an HSA has some additional advantages:
• Unused money in an HSA is not forfeited at the end of the year; it is carried forward
• Funds roll over each year
Your HSA is yours to keep which means, you can take it with you if you change jobs or retire. If you have any money remaining in your
HSA after your retirement, you may withdraw the money as cash. HSA highlights include:
Triple Tax Advantage
• Contributions are tax-free
• Investment earnings are tax-free
• Withdrawals for qualified health care expenses are tax-free
Employee Eligibility Rules

• Other IRS-approved expenses not covered under the medical plan such as dental or vision (IRS213d)
• Note: Withdrawals for non-qualified expenses will be taxed and include a 20% penalty
• For tax dependents, even if they are not enrolled in your medical plan
• To save the money in the account
• Funds roll over each year
• Pay retiree medical expenses
• Earn interest/investment earnings
• You OWN the account and can

Short Answer – The resources below contain a large number of suggestions for improving response rates. It is best to peruse all the suggestions and see which ones fit best. Unfortunately, there is not a small set of universal steps that will always work. All the resources are client shareable.

Long Answer –  

XM Institute blog article organizes activities into 4 main levers that can work for categorizing suggestions across all resources. Below are some highlights from across resources: 

Mode – Getting the survey to the customer  

Select a mode of delivery that will be most noticeable. An email is easily drowned out, so other modes like SMS can be valuable. However, you must balance this with the percentage of customers you can access through that channel. 

Make sure to utilize all Qualtrics configurations to ensure maximum email deliverability. 

Avoid words and email invitation choices that could increase the invitations spam score and decrease deliverability. For instance, avoid using the word “survey” in your invite. 

Send invitations at a day and time invitees are most likely to see it and be able to act on the request. Traditionally, B2B invites have been sent on Tuesday mornings (~7am local time).  

Send at least two reminders. There is diminishing returns after 2, but sending more can still get some new responses. Reminder should come at least 3-4 days apart (unless that is a weekend for B2B invitees). 2nd reminder should be at least a week after the invite. 

Sample – Who receives the survey.   

Use qualified, clean sample – contacts who are active customers with valid emails, etc. 

Make sure to send to the right customers who will provide useful feedback 

Don’t over-send invites and risk annoying customers. 

Design – What the invitation and survey looks like.  

Use invite language and visuals that inspire participation. 

Keep the survey short and focused on things the customer wants to tell – topics that matter to them. 

Action – How you respond to the survey & ensuring customers feel heard.   

Thank customers for participating  

Follow up with customer indicated issues  

Consider if offering incentives would help.  

Communicate improvement initiatives to customers ";3;4;735
122;"What's a good response rate?";"Short Answer – This is a complex issue encompassing many factors, and any figures should not be taken as law.  Even how “response rate” is determined.  At Walker, we’d advise using the percentage of those invited who started the survey.  “Starting” a survey can also be another nuance.  Generally, we advise that someone must answer one question.  There are not any great response rate benchmarks out there. Walker’s general guidance for response rates are as follows: 

For a Relational/NPS survey 

<10% weak  

10-30% moderate 

30-50% above par 

>50% world class  

For a Transactional survey 

<10% weak  

10-15% moderate 

16-25% above par 

>25% world class

123;"NPS, Loyalty, and Overall Experience/Overall Satisfaction in the same survey";"Short Answer – No, you don’t need all of them in the same survey, but it’s not bad to have all within a survey.  It depends on the organization’s goals and the stakeholders viewing the information. 

NPS – may be a measure for executives to look at things holistically. 

Loyalty – may be more tactical measure for account leaders to view. More relevant to front line employees. 

Overall Experience – this one can also work as an overall KPI, is used as KPI in transactional surveys.  Sometimes drivers of Loyalty/NPS are different than OEXP/OSAT.  

Overall, the trend across each of these will be consistent.  As one improves, the others tend to as well.

Walker does have a set of questions that we prefer to guide clients towards.  The previous document has some of them.  These should be prioritized over any question types not cited by the bot!  In general, the rating scale and related issues (direction, orientation, labels, etc.) have a small and often unmeasurable impact on data.  They are not all comparable to previous data in the event major changes are made, though. The key is to make a decision and stick to it. This research by Measuring U tests the impact of the core rating scale debates and finds little-to-no-impact regardless of the decision: https://measuringu.com/rating-scale-best-practices-8-topics-examined/  ";3;4;253
125;"Difference between satisfaction and quality/experience rating scales on data";"Short Answer – Satisfaction may be a lower bar in part due to social norms (e.g. Being “satisfied” by an experience is a lower sentiment than having and “excellent” experience).  This means people will gravitate towards answering the higher end of the scale naturally, reducing the variation of responses.  This is especially the case with bipolar satisfaction scales, leading to a not very good data distribution.  Research backs up this positivity-response bias.  We prefer Quality ratings because it addresses these issues by:   

Disconnecting somewhat from the idea of Satisfaction and associated norms. 

Using unipolar scales that add nuance to the positive sentiment of the responses (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor), thus increasing variation (better data distribution). 

Additional consideration: You can try to increase the variation of a satisfaction question in two ways: 1) Using a unipolar satisfaction rating scale (Extremely satisfied, Very, Somewhat, Not very, Not at all), or 2) Using stronger endpoints to increase the “distance” between the poles (Extremely satisfied -> Extremely dissatisfied). 

Related Questions: 

What differences in scores would you expect between satisfaction (5 point) and quality (5 point)?  We’d expect a decline in an “average (1-5)” from the Satisfaction item to the Quality item, but the difference may not be “significant”. ";3;4;314
126;"On a 7-point scale, do you report top 2 or top 3 box percentage scores?";"Short Answer – It depends on a lot of factors, but we still see a lot of 7-point scales using Top 2 box % scores. This is especially true when using a bipolar, satisfaction scale.  

Long Answer –   

If Top 2 % scores are unexpectedly low (<30%), then use Top 3 %. 

If Top 3 % scores are unexpectedly high (<80%), then consider using Top 2 %. You always want to leave a healthy room for improvement while still accurately recognizing companies with excellent performance levels.  

If you have a mix of 7-point and 5-point scales in your survey, then choose the score type (Top 2 % vs. Top 3 %) that gives you a score closest to the Top 2 % scores for the 5-point scale.  

Quality tends to be on unipolar scales (Poor-Excellent), so a rating that falls outside the Top-2 bucket of “Good” may not necessarily be a negative sentiment rating, it may have just been less positive.  The semantic line in sentiment is more ambiguous here. 

For 7-point bipolar, a 5 rating would be ambivalently positive, so leaving it out and only measuring 6-7 % ensures you have more strong positive attitudes.  For 5-point rating scale, this is also the same, despite it being a unipolar scale.   ";3;4;292
127;"positive or negative leading survey scales";"Short’ish Answer – There is a strong preference in academic and government research for negative-leading scales on self-administered surveys. Walker has traditionally used positive-leading scales driven partially by our history in telephone surveying (where primacy bias favored the last scale points the respondent heard), and partially by psychological theory suggesting people favor lists moving from most-to-least positive (e.g., Top 10 rankings, etc.). The most recent research on the topic indicates the direction of rating scales (positive-leading = Excellent->Poor; negative-leading = Poor->Excellent) has a small or non-significant effect on scores (https://measuringu.com/revisiting-the-left-side-bias/). If starting from scratch, going with negative-to-positive is the safest approach. If you already have a survey in place, consistency in scales over time is the most important thing to maintain trending, so avoid changing scale direction on an on-going program.  

Long Answer –  

The concern about the direction of rating scales is bias, specifically primacy bias. This states that items read first are more heavily weighted in a respondent’s decision than items read last. There is a long history of academic resaeach backing this up. 

If starting a survey/program from scratch, we should recommend using Negative leading to diminish positivity bias. 

If existing survey, consistency over time is most important so retain the positive-leading. 

There is a “primacy effect” in the academic world such that people tend to provide an answer farther left (if horizontally presented) on a scale.  In other words, if positive leading – the scores are going to be more positive on average than if they were negative leading.  It might be helpful for them to think about the problem as fitting a metric (scale) to a biased frame.  The subjective decision is to figure out which way you want fit that bias, aka the dilemma at hand. 

If they take positive leading, there’s a chance that their scores might be higher than negative leading scales (e.g. 85% vs 83%, respectively), and the scores may inflate perceptions.  It’s hard to know which way “correctly” reflects a respondent’s perception, so the question is more of consistency over time.  My personal opinions—survey distributions are already skewed to the positive, so if you’re starting to look at top box % scores that are in the upper 80s and 90s, is there much room left to improve?  I would prefer lower scores on average (negative leading) because that gives me more room to improve over time.   

It’s important to point out that the effect size is really small though, but has been found repeatedly over the decades.  It has become a fairly robust effect, and has been studied repeatedly in different contexts since the 80s (pre-2000s anyway).  The question has now turned more towards, “Where and when does the effect become most prominent?”   

A supporting article for the presence of rating scale direction effects is below and does a nice job of illustrating the effect across many question types (agreement, satisfaction, experience rating, frequencies, etc.).  

Another set of articles that questions the presence and effect of scale direction effects are below, which point out the lack of consistent or significant effects.

128;"Including "Don't know" "Not applicable" "N/A" as answer choice";"Short Answer – There’s no black and white here, it depends.  The literature (article citation in resources) says that the more potentially irrelevant a survey measure is, the more likely the midpoint is going to be used as a dumping ground for a response.  If you can guarantee that respondents should have a perception from the experience you’re measuring, then you could consider leaving it out.  So adding this option increases the quality of your responses.  Generally though, the quality gained in the data is likely going to outweigh the slight quantity increase in missing data. 

Long Answer –   

Including “Don’t Know”, “Not Applicable”, “N/A” at the end in conjunction with a midpoint (assuming bipolar scale) reduces the noise by providing those who truly don’t care or have an opinion a way out.  This makes the scores you do collect more valid, but increases your missing data for analysis, which is relevant for driver analysis. 

It’s important to take stock of the context of the survey (transactional? relational?) and the relevance of the items being asked.  If it’s a lengthy relational survey, it’s more likely that some items would be less relevant.  Consider using it here. 

Even if using experience rating, people can satisfice by providing inaccurately positive ratings that inflate scores, so still consider the item relevance with unipolar scales.

129;"Using 5-point likelihood to recommend or NPS scale";"Question:  Can you use a 5-point likelihood to recommend scale? 

Short Answer – To leverage the default reporting and benchmarks within Qualtrics, we strongly recommend keeping the original 0-10 scale. 
 If the client is insistent on this, then yes, it can be done. We used to use this version pre-NPS era.  Double check that the client is not interested in using the NPS-based scoring, reporting, or benchmarking in Qualtrics if considering. If using a 5-point scale, we recommend using our standard likelihood scale and the standard Top 2 box % reporting.  Link to scale document:

Additional considerations: If the client insists on creating NPS categories using the 5-point scale (which we wouldn’t recommend), then we’ve traditionally used the following approach: 

5 = Promoter 

4 = Passive 

3, 2, 1 = Detractor 

This categorization will generally yield a slightly lower % Promoters and slightly higher % Detractors and, therefore, a lower NPS than if using the standard 11-point NPS scale. ";3;4;311
130;"Vertical vs horizontal scale display";"Short Answer – This is mostly relevant to the auto-adjustment of orientation from Desktop-Horizontal to Mobil-Vertical.

131;"Emoji survey scales";"Short Answer – Growing research in the space.  There does seem to be some support for the efficacy of emoji scales compared to lexical scales.  If wanting to use by client, definitely NOT worth pushing back on.  Would probably be best used for transactional surveys or web intercepts.  Also make sure that the emojis make sense (no major color differences, styles, added animations, etc.).  There is no rating scale that is absolutely “superior” to another.  It is important to remember that there connotation differences within populations about emojis, especially generational differences. 

Long Answer – Aside from direct-to-survey research, it is well known that the interpretations of emojis evolve very rapidly, and often have disconnects across age groups and cultures. 

As long as the directionality can clearly be inferred, it seems like they are comparable. 

If the question relates to translations (wouldn’t have to translate scale points), that area is less studied than the translations for scales. 

May not be universally interpreted across cultures.  May not be good for global studies.

Short version:  Emoji scales were stronger predictors of Job SAT than Lexical scales both within the same person (same survey 2x) and between people (taking survey 1x but different scales). 

Compared 5-pt lexical scale with 5-pt emoji scale in Job SAT context 

First, they created the emoji scale by asking 56 participants to select the top 2 emojis that best represents each scale point on a 5-pt Strongly Dislike-Strongly Like scale. 5 different sets of emojis were tested like this, and the set with the highest consensus was used. This is a Thurston scale type approach.  Valid way to build scales.   

Undergrads comprised many different cultures built scale on consensus. 

Validation study with 569 US residents (M-Turk), randomly assigned to 4 blocks to take interest inventory 2x separated by distraction task. Each block was either both lexical scales, both emoji scales, or 1/2 emoji 1/2 lexical with randomized ordering.  Job SAT used different scale (Yes, ?, No) (Russell, 2004).  Allowed for testing both within person and between people. 

Within person results: 

Consistency across T1 and T2 survey was similar for all blocks. 

Hierarchical regressions for job interest congruence scores (1 for scale consistent blocks and 1 for mixed-scale blocks).  Mixed scale regressions had binary ordering variable to account for order effect.  In both regression sets, Emoji scale was a better predictor on job SAT than lexical scale. 

*Emoji scale was a better predictor of Job SAT than Lexical scale. 

Between people results: 

Looking at T1, emoji scale job interest congruence was significantly more correlated (r=.41) than the lexical scale (r=.13).   

*Emoji scale was sig a better predictor of job SAT.

132;"forcing responses in survey design and programming";"Short Answer – 

Generally in CX, forcing responses is only going to reduce completion rates. With response rates decreasing over time, it’s important to make design decisions that don’t frustrate the respondent and increase abandonment.  There are 2 main scenarios where this is helpful and appropriate though: 

The question is necessary for survey routing/skip logic 

We are using a paid panel for responses 

Response and completion rates are a top priority in the CX research space, as many individuals are voluntarily providing feedback, so they have no other incentive to complete the survey than their own volition.  Adding in friction will likely lead to decreased completion rates, and possibly fewer responses for analysis. ";3;4;150

Typically, we'll have somewhere between 3 and 5.  What's most important is the distinctions between them.  Typically, we ask about them in a section of "Images & Impressions" in the survey towards the beginning since these are more generalized, abstract, and holistic attitudes.  Usually one item evaluating one principle.";3;4;117
134;" global and subgroup KPI scoregoal setting";"The idea is to set targets that are far enough to be significant changes without being too lofty. 

Holistically, looking at a single global score, it’s best to leverage confidence intervals to identify at what point do we see a significant change with our expected base sizes and margin of error. 

When there are multiple distinct populations (e.g. Retail side, Corporate) that comprise the global scores, we need to factor in the segment sizes (weighting).  Ideally, we have the actual numbers from the client of how large the Retail and Corporate populations are.  Using historical response rates and referencing the actual population numbers, we can create weights that will adjust scores to reflect each population more accurately.

135;"Incentives for Employees to deliver good CX ";"Short Answer – If we are asked to provide input on the topic: 

Only incentives like social recognition or minor perks.  These are conducive to a positive culture.  The consequences don’t carry as much weight.  Small things like mini trophies, certificates, recognition at department meeting.  If monetary, should be small unexpected rewards that are not directly cash – lunch, coffee, gift card, etc. 

Generally, to not place bonuses or base compensation in the hands of these metrics.  More details below. 

Long Answer –  If bonuses/base compensation are linked to CX metrics, it can be a slippery slope to a place you didn’t imagine going.  Several negative impacts that typically result from this kind incentive: 

Frontline employees can game the system by only telling customers where an obvious positive interaction occurred or by explicitly begging for top box scores on their card.  These pleas can even go as far as guilting the customer into doing it – the ideology of “The fate my job is in your hands”.  Most commonly in retail industries where frontline are face-to-face with non-recorded calls. 

The shear weight of the anticipation of these consequences can be enough to burn employees out faster.   

The metrics themselves get heavily scrutinized by those impacted, calling for rigorous analysis to cross off all other reasons for a decline in scores.  If you have limited resources, your spending EXTRA money to justify the scores and taking resources away from strategizing and enacting ways to create positive experiences.  It’s a negative feedback loop that takes the focus away from the customer! ";3;4;348
136;"difference between MaxDiff and Conjoint";"What kinds of questions do conjoint projects answer?  What kinds of questions to MaxDiff questions answer?  How are they similar and how are they different? 

What they can answer? 

Conjoint – Asks about preference for options comprised of different combinations of attributes.  These are usually attributes about an option that are not obviously exclusive (e.g. Size, Color, Price).  What components have the most/least influence in determining preference for a whole offering?  How much are people willing to pay for each component? 

MaxDiff – Asks about preference for options that are exclusive of each other.  Usually within attribute preferences.  For example, the MaxDiff might be around choosing the ideal set of colors to produce.  MaxDiff will force respondents to select between different combinations of colors. 

How are they similar? 

They both require respondent to consider different options and the tradeoffs to select a preference. 

How are they different? 

Conjoints – are choices between options that have varying combinations of attributes.  Can evaluate impact of attribute category on top of specific attribute preference, and even willingness to pay (WTP) for them.

137;"Key driver widget relative importance or correlation";"Short answer – Do NOT use the Relative Importance option on the key driver widget at this time (as of 11/15/2023). This is the current default option, so you need to manually change the analysis method to “Pearson Correlation” for any new Key Driver Widgets you setup. 

Long answer - The Relative Importance Analysis method being used has a few flaws that could lead to severe misinterpretations and lead clients to make inaccurate recommendations to their stakeholders.  So, if you are creating a new Key Driver Widget for any client or are using it in reports, make sure that the widget is configured using the “Pearson Correlation” (the old method). There are two primary reasons for our recommendation: 

The Key Driver Widget uses a different reporting metric from the Relative Importance Analysis compared to what is highlighted and used in Stats iQ (unstandardized coefficient vs. relative weight). This will often result in different rank ordering between the Key Driver Widget and Stats iQ. Furthermore, we believe the metric used in the Key Driver Widget is incorrect for the purpose of the widget and could lead to severely flawed interpretations under certain circumstances. 

The Relative Importance Analysis in the Key Driver Widget is still using listwise deletion. This means that the only uses respondents who have answered ALL of the potential drivers, which, depending on skip patterns and missing data, could be a very tiny subset of your full dataset. However, the widget never indicates the base size used in the analysis. In fact, the widget will show the base size of the outcome metric, which is often wrong for this type of analysis. This could lead clients to make decisions that apply to their entire response sample based on Importance scores that could only apply to a very small subsegment of respondents. 

If you’re interested in more detail on these issues, or if you have a client who wants more detail or is insistent on using the Relative Importance method, please reach out to Team Katmai.";3;4;422
138;"Full scale vs end point only with numeric scale labels";"Short Answer – Fully Labeled scales tend to yield more reliable results and place less interpretation burden on the respondent. 

There’s a lot of research out there actually pointing towards fully labeled scales as providing more reliable and valid measurement.  Krosnick & Fabrigar (1997) and Krosnick (1999) are two of the most foundational compilations of research on this.  Link: https://web.stanford.edu/dept/communication/faculty/krosnick/docs/1999/1999%20Maximizing%20questionnaire%20quality.pdf. Menold et al (2014) demonstrated through eye tracking that respondents pay more attention to all scale points than end-point only labels and it resulted in a closer to normal distribution of data than end-point only, which yielded more significantly skewed data.

Longer attention time doesn’t necessarily mean more difficult though.  Another NIH article (Hamby & Taylor, 2016) found that the end-point only with numeric labels may place more burden on the respondent and lead to artificially inflated correlations between entirely different constructs due to the consistency in rating.  Link:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5965608/.  The artificially inflated correlations indicate that the responder behavior was actually different.  This type of scenario seems relevant for asking for ratings across different experience areas, which could affect identifying key drivers.   

Another common rationale, consistent with interpretation burden being placed on the respondent, is that the end point only scale requires participants to translate the numbers into another semantic meaning for themselves to decide.  This may actually be more subjective and ambiguous than more explicit semantic labels for all options. 

The literature strongly favors rating scales with a verbal label on each scale pointA customer effort question might be better served by a verbally-labeled scale to help guide the respondent on what they are rating. If you ask them to rate their effort, respondents could be confused on what a 5-star rating means. The labels will also help with reporting (e.g., 60% of customers agreed that it was easy to handle their issue).  

One issue with “customer effort” is the multiple ways that CES (customer effort score) has been captured. The current guidance by Gartner is to use a 7-pt agreement scale, but their first version used a 5-point high-to-low effort scale. Since Gartner has done a poor job of creating any benchmarks around CES, I usually let clients decide how they want to ask the question with a few options. This article from In-Moment (a competitor) actually contains the three options I usually give clients EXCEPT I prefer a fully-labeled 5-point scale for the last question they list (Extremely easy, Very easy, Somewhat easy, Not very easy, Not easy at all) ";3;4;1010
139;"single response report links";"- the single response report link leads to a pdf report of the individual survey response
- A New Response report isn't available until the response is submitted. This means that the response report link isn't available in the survey flow, but is available in workflows triggered off of the survey. To make the link available in the survey response one could configure a workflow to API update the survey response with the link upon receiving the new survey response.
