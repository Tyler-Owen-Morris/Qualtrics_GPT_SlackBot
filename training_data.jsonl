{"question": "What are the identifying fields from the contact list for Google OAuth 2.0 and Facebook authenticators?", "answer": "For Google OAuth 2.0: First Name -> FirstName, Last Name -> LastName, Email -> Email, External Data Reference -> UserName. For Facebook: First Name -> first_name, Last Name -> last_name, Email -> email, External Data Reference -> email."}
{"question": "What is the Maximum Authentication Attempts setting in SSO authenticator?", "answer": "It's a setting under Options that allows you to set a limit on the number of authentication attempts. However, it's generally not recommended for SSO authenticators, as the Qualtrics survey is unaware of login failures on the SSO landing page."}
{"question": "When would Maximum Authentication Attempts be useful for an SSO authenticator?","answer": "Maximum Authentication Attempts would be useful for an SSO authenticator if 'Associate Respondent With Panel' is enabled. In this case, the failure would occur because the user didn't match the contacts in the connected list."}
{"question": "What does the error AUTHENTICATOR_SSO_CONFIG_DISABLED mean?", "answer": "This error means a Brand Administrator needs to enable 'Use for survey authenticator' for the SSO connection."}
{"question": "What does the error AUTHENTICATOR_SSO_CONFIG_NOT_FOUND mean?", "answer": "This error means the SSO connection was not found in the SSO Provider Service, possibly due to data syncing issues or because the connection was deleted. A Brand Administrator may need to enable 'Use for survey authenticator' for the SSO connection."}
{"question": "Can I test the setup of my Google OAuth 2.0 or Facebook authenticator?", "answer": "Yes, you can test the setup using the anonymous link."}
{"question": "What are some examples of Google OAuth 2.0 attributes?", "answer": "Examples of Google OAuth 2.0 attributes include: FirstName, LastName, and Email."}
{"question": "What are some examples of Facebook attributes?", "answer": "Examples of Facebook attributes include: name, first_name, last_name, link, gender, and email."}
{"question": "How do I add approved account email domains to restrict access to my survey?", "answer": "Add approved account email domains to the 'Restrict Authentication to Domain(s)' field without the @ symbol (e.g., 'gmail.com' or 'qualtrics.com'). For multiple domains, enter them as a comma-separated list (e.g., 'gmail.com, qualtrics.com')."}
{"question": "Why am I getting an error message 'Unable to login with information provided'?", "answer": "This error message means that the SSO connection worked, but the information does not match what's in your contact list."}
{"question": "What do I need to do if I get an error message when using the 'Associate Respondent With Panel' option?", "answer": "Check that the information provided by the respondent matches the information in your contact list. If necessary, update the contact list to resolve the error."}
{"question": "What are some other uses of an Authenticator?", "answer": "Apart from authentication, an Authenticator can be employed to load embedded data into a survey without relying on the respondent funnel. This can be achieved by adding the data to a directory mailing list and using the Authenticator to look up the data based on the 'external data reference.' This method offers more flexibility than supplemental data projects, as directories allow adding fields as needed, while supplemental data projects limit the number of fields upon creation."}
{"question": "What are some alternative uses of an Authenticator?", "answer": "An Authenticator can be utilized for loading embedded data into a survey without depending on the respondent funnel. To do this, store the data in a directory mailing list and use the Authenticator to retrieve the data using the 'external data reference.' This approach provides greater flexibility than supplemental data projects, which restrict the number of fields during creation, while directories permit adding fields as required."}
{"question": "What are some other uses of an Authenticator?", "answer": "An Authenticator can serve as a tool to import embedded data into a survey without the need for a respondent funnel. This can be accomplished by saving the data in a directory mailing list and leveraging the Authenticator to access the data based on the 'external data reference.' This method offers increased flexibility compared to supplemental data projects, which have a limited number of fields at the creation stage, while directories allow for adding fields whenever necessary."}
{"question": "What are some alternative uses of an Authenticator?", "answer": "An Authenticator can be employed to import embedded data into a survey independently of the respondent funnel. To achieve this, insert the data into a directory mailing list and use the Authenticator to fetch the data by referencing the 'external data reference.' This technique provides more adaptability than supplemental data projects, which impose field limitations during creation, while directories enable adding fields on-demand."}
{"question": "What are some other ways an Authenticator can be used?", "answer": "An Authenticator can be used to bring embedded data into a survey without necessitating the respondent funnel. This is done by placing the data in a directory mailing list and then utilizing the Authenticator to access the data via the 'external data reference.' This process offers greater versatility than supplemental data projects, which constrain the number of fields at the outset, while directories allow for the addition of fields as needed."}
